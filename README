GnuplotIF version 1.7
=====================

GnuplotIF is a simple and easy to use Perl interface to gnuplot.  gnuplot is a
freely available, command-driven graphical display tool for Unix.  It compiles
and works quite well on a number of Unix flavours as well as other operating
systems. The following module enables sending display requests to gnuplot
through simple Perl subroutine calls.

GnuplotIF starts gnuplot as a separate process. The plot commands are send
through a pipe.  The graphical output from gnuplot will be displayed
immediately.

Several independent plots can be started from one script.  Each plot has its
own pipe.  All pipes will be closed automatically when the script terminates.
The gnuplot processes terminate when the corresponding pipes are closed.  Their
graphical output will now disappear.

GnuplotIF is similar to gnuplot_i , a C interface to gnuplot 
( http://ndevilla.free.fr/gnuplot/ ), and to  gnuplot_i++ , a C++ interface
to gnuplot ( http://jijo.cjb.net/code/cc++ ).
